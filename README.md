# BrownBook

A gamified task tracker app built with Electron. Turn your daily to-dos into a rewarding experience!

## Features

- **Task Management**: Create one-time tasks and recurring tasks.
- **Interval Recurring Tasks**: Set up complex schedules like "3 days on, 1 day off" for gym routines.
- **Reward System**: Earn coins for completing tasks (`Hard` tasks = more coins!).
- **Rewards Shop**: Spend coins on custom rewards. Shop prices increase after each purchase daily to prevent spamming!
- **History & Stats**: Track your completion history and total earnings.
- **Visuals**: Coin animations, clean UI, and satisfying interactions.
- **Data Privacy**: All data is stored locally on your machine.
